# _AERO-CANVAS_ 

AeroCanvas is an AI-powered Air Canvas application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, inspired by virtual drawing tools and smart-board experiences.
No mouse. No stylus. Just your fingers and Computer Vision.

🎨 How It Works

AeroCanvas uses real-time hand tracking to detect finger movements through a webcam and converts those gestures into digital strokes on a virtual canvas.
	•	Raise your index finger to draw
	•	Change hand positions to switch colors or tools
	•	Move freely in the air — the canvas follows
